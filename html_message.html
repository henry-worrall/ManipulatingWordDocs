    Dear SCHOOL TEACHER NAME,
    <p>
        This is an example of an html message which could be sent in the email to SCHOOL NAME HERE.
    </p>
    <p>
        This allows for the email to be nicely formatted, e.g. by using <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> text.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
        Like all html, you can change the format to be <span style="font-family:'Courier New'; font-size:30px; color: red">whatever you like!</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Attached you'll find the data that I'm using to send to different schools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kind regards,<br>
        The Creator
    </p>
